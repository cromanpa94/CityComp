# The CityComp Shiny app

### A comparative framework to identify the similarity of cities across the globe


## What is `CityComp`?

`CityComp` is a Shiny app developed to support the use of the comparative framework developed in Arechiga et al. (2023). In the app, users can directly visualize the results presented in the same paper. Specifically, a graphical and interactive version of Fig. 6 in the same paper is presented in the app. Users can further define a target city and estimate their similarity to cities across the globe. Dynamic filtering and mapping is implemented within the app.
